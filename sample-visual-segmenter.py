Clarifai Visual Segmentation Demo

This script demonstrates how to use Clarifai's image segmentation model to identify
and analyze different segments/regions within an image. Image segmentation is the
process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, each representing
different objects or parts of objects.

# Import necessary libraries
from clarifai.client.model import Model  # Clarifai's Model class for API interactions
import os  # For accessing environment variables

# =============================================================================
# SECURITY SETUP: Get API credentials from environment variables
# =============================================================================
# Instead of hardcoding your API key in the script (which is insecure), 
# we retrieve it from an environment variable. This is a security best practice.
# 
# To set your environment variable, run:
# export CLARIFAI_PAT="your_actual_api_key_here"
pat = os.getenv('CLARIFAI_PAT')

# Check if the PAT was successfully retrieved
if not pat:
    raise ValueError(
        "‚ùå Please set the CLARIFAI_PAT environment variable\n"
        "Run: export CLARIFAI_PAT='your_actual_api_key_here'\n"
        "Get your PAT from: https://clarifai.com/settings/security"

# INPUT CONFIGURATION: Define the image to analyze
# =============================================================================

# This image contains people walking, which will be segmented into different regions

# MODEL SETUP: Initialize the Clarifai segmentation model

# Define the URL of Clarifai's general image segmentation model
# This model can identify and segment various objects and regions in images
model_url = "https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/image-general-segmentation"

# Create a Model instance with our credentials and make a prediction
# The predict_by_url() method sends the image URL to Clarifai for analysis
model_prediction = Model(url=model_url, pat=pat).predict_by_url(image_url)

# =============================================================================
# RESULTS PROCESSING: Extract and display segmentation results
# =============================================================================
# The prediction results contain regions - different segments of the image
# Each region has concepts (what was detected) with confidence values

        # Extract the concept name (what was detected)

        # The confidence represents how much of the region this concept covers
        print(f"   ‚Ä¢ {name}: {confidence} ({confidence * 100:.2f}% confidence)")
