- `README.md` - This comprehensive guide

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before you start, you'll need:

1. **Python 3.8+** installed on your computer
2. **A Clarifai account** and Personal Access Token (PAT)
   - Sign up at [clarifai.com](https://clarifai.com)
   - Get your PAT from your account settings at [clarifai.com/settings/security](https://clarifai.com/settings/security)
3. **Basic understanding of Python** (variables, functions, imports)
4. **A code editor** like VS Code (recommended) or any text editor

## Quick Start Guide üöÄ

### 1. Clone or Download this project

```bash
# If using git
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd demo-clarifai-api

# Or just download the files to a folder called demo-clarifai-api
```

### 2. Install Python packages

The easiest way to install all required packages is using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
# Install all packages from requirements.txt (recommended)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What this installs:**

- `clarifai>=11.6.0` - Official Clarifai Python SDK
- `openai>=1.0.0` - For OpenAI-compatible API access
- `Pillow>=10.0.0` - Image processing library
- `numpy` - Numerical computing (for image arrays)
- `opencv-python` - Computer vision library (for image processing)

**Alternative installation methods:**

```bash
# If you prefer to install packages one by one
pip install clarifai openai Pillow numpy opencv-python

# For conda users
conda create -n clarifai-demo python=3.11
conda activate clarifai-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up your API key (Important for Security!) üîê

Instead of putting your API key directly in the code (which is unsafe), we use environment variables.

**Get your PAT:**

1. Go to [clarifai.com/settings/security](https://clarifai.com/settings/security)
2. Create a new Personal Access Token
3. Copy the token (it starts with something like `Key_...`)

**Set the environment variable:**

**On Linux/Mac (Terminal):**

```bash
export CLARIFAI_PAT="your_actual_api_key_here"

# To make it permanent, add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
echo 'export CLARIFAI_PAT="your_actual_api_key_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
set CLARIFAI_PAT=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:CLARIFAI_PAT="your_actual_api_key_here"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your real Clarifai PAT!**

### 4. Test your setup

Run a simple example to make sure everything works:

```bash
python sample-text-to-text-stream.py
```

You should see an AI response about the future of AI, appearing word by word!

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Installation Issues

#### "Import could not be resolved" or "ModuleNotFoundError"

**Problem:** Python can't find the required packages.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# 1. Make sure you installed the packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Check if packages are installed
pip list | grep -E "(clarifai|openai|opencv|numpy)"

# 3. If using conda, make sure you're in the right environment
conda activate your_environment_name
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Try upgrading pip first
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'"

**Problem:** OpenCV (cv2) is not installed properly.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Try these installation methods in order:
pip install opencv-python
# or
pip install opencv-contrib-python
# or
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

### API and Authentication Issues

#### "Please set the CLARIFAI_PAT environment variable"

**Problem:** Your API key is not set as an environment variable.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Linux/Mac
export CLARIFAI_PAT="your_actual_api_key_here"

# Windows Command Prompt
set CLARIFAI_PAT=your_actual_api_key_here

# Windows PowerShell
$env:CLARIFAI_PAT="your_actual_api_key_here"

# Make it permanent by adding to your shell config file
echo 'export CLARIFAI_PAT="your_key_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### "Authentication failed" or "Invalid token"

**Problem:** Your API key is incorrect or expired.

**Solutions:**

1. Get a new PAT from [clarifai.com/settings/security](https://clarifai.com/settings/security)
2. Make sure you copied the entire key (starts with `Key_...`)
3. Check for extra spaces or characters when setting the environment variable
4. Verify your Clarifai account is active and has API access

### Runtime Errors

#### "IndexError: list index out of range"

**Problem:** The AI model didn't return expected results.

**Solutions:**

1. Check if the image URL is accessible
2. Try a different image or model
3. Verify your internet connection
4. Look at the raw API response for debugging

#### "Network errors" or "Connection timeout"

**Problem:** Can't connect to Clarifai's servers.

**Solutions:**

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try again in a few minutes (server might be busy)
3. Check if your firewall is blocking the connection
4. Verify Clarifai's service status

### Image Processing Issues

#### Generated images are corrupted or won't open

**Problem:** Image conversion failed during processing.

**Solutions:**

```python
# Add error checking to your image processing:
if img_np is not None and img_np.size > 0:
    cv2.imwrite("output.jpg", img_np)
    print("‚úÖ Image saved successfully")
else:
    print("‚ùå Failed to process image data")
```

#### "Permission denied" when saving files

**Problem:** Don't have write permissions in the current directory.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check current directory permissions
ls -la

# Change to a directory where you have write permissions
cd ~/Documents  # or any folder you own

# Run the script from there
python /path/to/your/script.py
```

### Performance Issues

#### Scripts running very slowly

**Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Large images:** Resize images before processing
2. **Slow internet:** Use local images when possible
3. **Model complexity:** Some models take longer than others
4. **Server load:** Try running at different times

#### Out of memory errors

**Solutions:**

```bash
# For large image processing, try:
pip install opencv-python-headless  # Lighter version
# or reduce image size in your code before processing
```

### Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the error message carefully** - it often tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Read the full traceback** - the error location helps identify the problem
3. **Try the examples in order** - start with simple text generation before complex image processing
4. **Check Clarifai's status page** - services might be temporarily down
5. **Visit the documentation** - [docs.clarifai.com](https://docs.clarifai.com)

### Debugging Tips

#### Enable verbose output

```python
# Add print statements to see what's happening:
print(f"PAT loaded: {'Yes' if pat else 'No'}")
print(f"Image URL: {image_url}")
print(f"Model prediction type: {type(model_prediction)}")
```

#### Check API responses

```python
# Before processing results, check if they exist:
if model_prediction.outputs and len(model_prediction.outputs) > 0:
    # Process results
    pass
else:
    print("No outputs received from the model")
```
